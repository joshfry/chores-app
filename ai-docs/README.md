## üéØ Reading Strategy

**For most tasks:** Start with `.agent-notes.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and `QUICK_STANDARDS.md`  
**For complex tasks:** Add relevant detailed guides as needed  
**For new features:** Read full documentation set  
**For quality issues:** Check `QA_REPORT.md` for known gaps and recommendations

## üè¢ Key Principle

This is **enterprise-grade software** with professional standards. All work must maintain the established quality level of 90%+ test coverage, complete documentation, and production-ready security.
