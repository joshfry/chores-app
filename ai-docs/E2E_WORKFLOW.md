# 🧪 **End-to-End Testing Status**

## ❌ Cypress Removed

Cypress end-to-end testing has been fully removed from this project. No E2E tooling or workflows are currently configured.

## ✅ Remaining Test Suites

- **Backend Unit & Integration Tests**: `pnpm run test:backend`
- **Frontend Unit Tests**: `pnpm run test:frontend`
- **Comprehensive Unit Coverage**: `pnpm run test:comprehensive` (runs backend & frontend suites + coverage)

## 📝 Next Steps

If end-to-end coverage is required in the future, evaluate a replacement such as Playwright or Detox (for mobile) and update this documentation with the new tooling and workflow.
