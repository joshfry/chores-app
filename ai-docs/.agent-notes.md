# 🤖 **AGENT INSTRUCTIONS - CRITICAL**

## ⚠️ **MANDATORY READING FOR ALL FUTURE AGENTS**

**Before making ANY changes to this codebase, you MUST read and follow the enterprise standards:**

### 📋 **Required Reading (Context-Optimized):**

#### **For Most Tasks (Read This - ~500 tokens):**

1. **[`QUICK_STANDARDS.md`](./QUICK_STANDARDS.md)** - 1-page enterprise essentials
2. **[`README.md`](./README.md)** - Project overview

#### **For Complex Tasks (Add These - ~1500 total tokens):**

3. **[`ENTERPRISE_STANDARDS.md`](./ENTERPRISE_STANDARDS.md)** - Complete standards reference
4. **[`TESTING_GUIDE.md`](./TESTING_GUIDE.md)** - Testing details
5. **[`WORKSPACE_TESTS.md`](./WORKSPACE_TESTS.md)** - Test infrastructure

---

## 🎯 **KEY REQUIREMENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS**

### **ENTERPRISE-READY STANDARD**

Everything developed for this project MUST be enterprise-ready:

- ✅ **90%+ test coverage** (currently 95% backend, 87% frontend)
- ✅ **Production-grade security** (proper auth, validation, error handling)
- ✅ **Complete documentation** (README, API docs, troubleshooting)
- ✅ **TypeScript with full type safety** (no `any` types)
- ✅ **CI/CD ready** (proper exit codes, automated testing)
- ✅ **Professional quality** (not prototype or hobby project level)

### **CURRENT ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL**

This project has **110+ comprehensive tests** across:

- Backend: 32+ tests (auth models, middleware, API routes)
- Frontend: 33+ tests (components, services, context)
- E2E: 45+ tests (complete user journeys)

**You must maintain or exceed this quality level.**

## 🚨 **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**

### **BEFORE WRITING CODE:**

1. Read `ENTERPRISE_STANDARDS.md` completely
2. Study existing code patterns and quality
3. Understand the testing infrastructure
4. Review security implementation patterns

### **FOR EVERY CHANGE:**

1. Write comprehensive tests (unit + integration + E2E as needed)
2. Follow existing TypeScript patterns
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add/update documentation
5. Ensure security best practices

### **BEFORE SUBMITTING:**

1. Run `pnpm test` - all tests must pass
2. Run `pnpm run test:coverage` - maintain coverage levels
3. Update documentation for any changes
4. Verify no security vulnerabilities introduced

## 📊 **QUALITY STANDARDS ACHIEVED**

This codebase represents **enterprise-level software development**:

- 🎯 **Testing**: 110+ tests across all layers with high coverage
- 🔐 **Security**: Production-ready auth with magic tokens, session management
- 📚 **Documentation**: Professional-grade docs with multiple guides
- ⚙️ **Architecture**: Scalable, maintainable, type-safe codebase
- 🚀 **CI/CD**: Automated testing, proper exit codes, workspace configuration

**Any regression in these standards is unacceptable.**

---

## 🔍 **QUALITY CHECKLIST**

For every change, verify:

- [ ] Tests written and passing (90%+ coverage maintained)
- [ ] TypeScript properly typed (no `any` types)
- [ ] Security patterns followed
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Enterprise standards maintained

---

## 📞 **WHEN IN DOUBT**

1. **Look at existing code** - it demonstrates the expected quality level
2. **Follow established patterns** - don't reinvent, extend professionally
3. **Maintain test coverage** - comprehensive testing is non-negotiable
4. **Ask about enterprise requirements** - when standards aren't clear

---

**🏢 REMEMBER: This is enterprise-grade software. Code like you're building for production at a Fortune 500 company.**

_This note ensures consistent quality across all agents working on this project._
