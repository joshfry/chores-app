# âœ… Assignment Redesign - COMPLETE!

## What Changed

### **Database Schema**

âœ… **Assignment Model Redesigned:**

- Now represents a **weekly collection of chores** (Sunday-Saturday)
- Changed from single chore to **many-to-many relationship** with chores
- Fields: `id`, `childId`, `startDate` (always Sunday), `endDate` (always Saturday), `status`, `notes`, `familyId`

âœ… **New AssignmentChore Junction Table:**

- Links assignments to multiple chores
- Tracks individual chore completion: `status` (pending/completed/skipped)
- Tracks completion day: `completedOn` (day of week)

âœ… **Chore Model Updated:**

- Replaced `recurrencePattern` with `recurrenceDays`
- Stores days as JSON array: `["monday", "wednesday", "friday"]`
- Allows selecting specific days of the week

âœ… **New Enum:**

- `ChoreStatus`: pending, completed, skipped

---

## **Frontend Changes**

### **New Components:**

1. **`RecurrenceDaysSelector.tsx`** - Checkbox UI for selecting days of week
2. **`CreateAssignmentModal.tsx`** - Redesigned to:
   - Select multiple chores (checkboxes)
   - Auto-calculate next Sunday as start date
   - Show chore recurrence days in selection list

3. **`AssignmentsPage.tsx`** - Completely rebuilt to:
   - Display assignments as weekly chore collections
   - Show all chores in each assignment
   - Toggle individual chore status (pending/completed)
   - Display week date range (Sun-Sat)

### **Updated Components:**

- **`CreateChoreModal.tsx`** - Uses day selector instead of dropdown
- **`EditChoreModal.tsx`** - Uses day selector
- **`ChoresPage.tsx`** - Displays recurrence days (e.g., "Days: monday, wednesday")
- **`DashboardPage.tsx`** - Shows assignments with chore count

### **Types Updated:**

- `Assignment` interface - new structure with `chores` array
- `AssignmentChore` interface - junction table representation
- `Chore` interface - `recurrenceDays` as string array

---

## **Backend Changes**

### **Routes:**

1. **`routes/assignments.ts`** - Completely rewritten:
   - `GET /api/assignments` - Returns assignments with all chores
   - `POST /api/assignments` - Creates assignment with multiple chores
   - `PATCH /api/assignments/:id/chores/:choreId` - Update individual chore status
   - `DELETE /api/assignments/:id` - Deletes assignment (cascade deletes chores)

2. **`routes/chores.ts`** - Updated:
   - Mock responses use `recurrence_days` instead of `recurrence_pattern`
   - JSON stringify for day arrays

### **Models:**

- **`models/auth-prisma.ts`** - Updated seed data:
  - Creates chores with `recurrenceDays`
  - Creates sample weekly assignment with multiple chores
  - Proper cleanup order for foreign keys

## **API Changes**

### **New Endpoints:**

- `PATCH /api/assignments/:assignmentId/chores/:choreId` - Toggle chore status

### **Updated Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/assignments` - Now accepts:

  ```json
  {
    "childId": 1,
    "startDate": "2024-10-06", // Sunday
    "choreIds": [1, 2, 3],
    "notes": "Optional notes"
  }
  ```

- `GET /api/assignments` - Now returns:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "childId": 1,
    "childName": "Emma",
    "startDate": "2024-10-06",
    "endDate": "2024-10-12",
    "status": "assigned",
    "chores": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "choreId": 1,
        "status": "pending",
        "completedOn": null,
        "chore": {
          /* full chore details */
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

## **How It Works Now**

### **Creating an Assignment:**

1. Parent selects a child
2. Selects multiple chores (checkboxes)
3. Sets start date (auto-suggests next Sunday)
4. System calculates end date (6 days later - Saturday)
5. Creates assignment with all selected chores in "pending" status

### **Tracking Completion:**

1. Each chore in assignment has independent status
2. Child/parent can mark individual chores complete
3. System tracks which day it was completed
4. Assignment status reflects overall progress

### **Chore Recurrence:**

1. When creating chore, check specific days (Mon-Sun)
2. Days stored as JSON array in database
3. UI shows selected days (e.g., "monday, wednesday, friday")
